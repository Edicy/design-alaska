There are several established campsites on this stretch with great views up-valley. Look for moose in the willow-shrouded creek corridor. Here the trail becomes steep, faint, and obstructed by several down trees. 

Though brief, this section is difficult to navigate and reclaim the trail once off course. Pay close attention to your progress and location.
